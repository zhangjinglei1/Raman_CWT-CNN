CWT-SerumCODE: Deep Learning-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy for Lung Cancer DiagnosisThis repository contains the official implementation of CWT-SerumCODE (Continuous Wavelet Transform Serum Consensus Oncology Detection), a framework that combines spontaneous serum Raman spectroscopy with interpretable deep learning for rapid lung cancer screening.📌 Project OverviewThis study addresses the challenges of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and complex biological backgrounds in spontaneous Raman spectra by:Transforming 1D Raman signals into 2D scalograms using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT).Utilizing a modified GoogLeNet (Inception v1) architecture for multi-scale feature extraction.Providing mechanistic transparency through Grad-CAM interpretability analysis.🛠 PrerequisitesPython: 3.8+PyTorch: 1.10+Torchvision: 0.11+Other Dependencies: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, PIL, PyWavelets (for CWT)Install the required packages:🚀 Model Architecture & TrainingThe core of our framework is a GoogLeNet backbone modified for binary classification:Input Size: 224 × 224 × 3Output: 2 nodes (Cancer vs. Control)Optimizer: Adam ($\beta_1=0.9, \beta_2=0.99$)Learning Rate: Initial $1 \times 10^{-4}$ with CosineAnnealingLR scheduling ($T_{max}=200$)Loss Function: Focal Loss (to handle potential class imbalance)Regularization: Dropout (0.5)📂 Repository StructureCNN_lung_serum-pro.ipynb: The primary notebook for model training, testing, and validation.preprocessing/: Scripts for CWT transformation (gaus2 wavelet, scales 1–1017).models/: GoogLeNet architecture definitions and weights.utils/: Data loading and Grad-CAM visualization utilities.📊 Key ResultsValidation Accuracy: 90.5% (Independent cohort, $n=21$).Statistical Robustness: 1,000-iteration Bootstrap analysis and 5-fold cross-validation.AUC 95% CI: 0.828 – 0.975.📝 UsagePreprocessing: Convert your .txt or .csv Raman data into 2D CWT scalograms using the gaus2 mother wavelet.Training: Run the training cells in CNN_lung_serum-pro.ipynb or execute the training script:Inference: Evaluate the model performance on the independent test set using the saved .pth weights.⚠️ StatementThis research is a preliminary, proof-of-concept investigation.
